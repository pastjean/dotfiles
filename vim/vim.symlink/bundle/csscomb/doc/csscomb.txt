ABOUT                                                          *csscomb-about*

The algorithm of CSScomb simulates web-technologist's actions upon working
with CSS-code to the limit. Usually to re-order code you move lines over each
other considering comments in the code, multilines records of property values,
hacks and everything that could be found in the real file. CSScomb reproduces
these actions for you. This means that the parser "thinks" as a person editing
the text, not as a blind robot parsing CSS.

For more info, online demo and tests see http://csscomb.com

What can CSScomb do?

* Sorts CSS-properties within the selectors according to the settings.

* Treats the initial formatting of style sheets carefully.

* Sorts commented properties as if they are not commented.

* Moves down unknown properties in the order they are met within the selector.
  E.g.: he\ight: 100% and similar will be taken as the unknown ones.

* Successfully parses @media ... {...} and any other constructions with @.

* Successfully parses expressions and then moves them to the end of the
  properties in the order they are met within the framework of properties of
  one selector.

CUSTOM SORT ORDER                                  *csscomb-custom-sort-order*

For adjusting plugins use one-dimensional and two-dimensional JSON arrays.
In case of two-dimensional arrays the properties will be divided into groups
with an empty line. In plugins you should pick open file csscomb.php
